## Filter Types Explained

### Butterworth Filter
A maximally flat magnitude filter providing smooth frequency response with minimal passband ripple.
```cpp
auto butterworthFilter = butter<1>(MCP_NORMALIZED_CUT_OFF);
float filteredValue = butterworthFilter(rawReading);
```
- **Advantages**: Excellent frequency response, minimal distortion
- **Best for**: Removing high-frequency noise while preserving signal integrity

### Simple Moving Average (SMA)
Averages the last N samples to reduce random noise.
```cpp
SMA<50, int32_t, int32_t> simpleMovingAvg = {0};
int averagedValue = simpleMovingAvg(rawReading);
```
- **Advantages**: Easy to understand, computationally efficient
- **Best for**: Reducing white noise in relatively stable signals

### Median Filter
Selects the median value from a window of samples, excellent for removing outliers.
```cpp
MedianFilter<50, int32_t> medianFilter = {0};
int medianFilteredValue = medianFilter(rawReading);
```
- **Advantages**: Removes spikes and outliers without affecting other values
- **Best for**: Environments with occasional interference or sudden spikes

### Notch Filter
Removes a specific frequency while leaving other frequencies largely unaffected.
```cpp
auto notchFilter = simpleNotchFIR(NOTCH_FREQUENCY);
float notchedValue = notchFilter(rawReading);
```
- **Advantages**: Targets specific noise frequencies (e.g., 50/60Hz power line interference)
- **Best for**: Systems with known noise sources at specific frequencies

### Custom Running Average
Efficient implementation of a moving average using a circular buffer.
```cpp
int customRunningAverage = computeRunningAverage(rawReading);
```
- **Advantages**: Memory efficient, can be optimized for specific applications
- **Best for**: Resource-constrained environments requiring noise reduction

## Filter Performance Comparison

| Filter Type | CPU Usage | Memory Usage | Group Delay | Noise Reduction | Spike Rejection |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Butterworth | Medium    | Low          | Medium      | Excellent       | Good            |
| SMA         | Low       | Medium       | High        | Good            | Poor            |
| Median      | High      | High         | Medium      | Good            | Excellent       |
| Notch       | Medium    | Low          | Low         | Targeted        | Poor            |
| Running Avg | Low       | Medium       | High        | Good            | Poor            |

## Hardware Setup

Default pin configuration:
- SDI (MOSI): Pin 11
- SDO (MISO): Pin 12
- SCK: Pin 13
- CS: Pin 7
- IRQ: Pin 6

## Key Filter Parameters

When using these examples, consider adjusting these key parameters:

### Butterworth Filter
```cpp
constexpr double SAMPLING_FREQUENCY = 11111;  // Your actual ADC sampling rate
constexpr double CUT_OFF_FREQUENCY = 2;       // Adjust based on signal characteristics
constexpr double NORMALIZED_CUT_OFF = 2 * CUT_OFF_FREQUENCY / SAMPLING_FREQUENCY;
```

### SMA and Median Filters
```cpp
// Increase window size for more smoothing, decrease for faster response
SMA<50, int32_t, int32_t> simpleMovingAvg = {0};
MedianFilter<50, int32_t> medianFilter = {0};
```

### Notch Filter
```cpp
// Set to the frequency you want to remove (e.g., 50Hz for power line)
constexpr double NOTCH_FREQUENCY = 50;
```

## Filter Selection Guide

1. **For general noise reduction:**
   - Start with Butterworth filter with cutoff at ~10% of your signal bandwidth

2. **For eliminating random spikes:**
   - Use Median filter with window size based on spike duration

3. **For power line interference:**
   - Use Notch filter centered at 50Hz or 60Hz

4. **For resource-constrained systems:**
   - Use Simple Moving Average or Custom Running Average

5. **For optimal results:**
   - Consider cascading filters (e.g., Median â†’ Butterworth)
