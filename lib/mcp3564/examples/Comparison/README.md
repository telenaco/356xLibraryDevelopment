## Analysis Methodology

The comparison examples follow this methodology:
1. Configure both ADCs for optimal performance
2. Apply identical load/weight to both sensors
3. Record data simultaneously from both ADCs
4. Apply identical filtering when applicable
5. Analyze timing, accuracy, and noise characteristics

## Data Analysis

For best results analyzing the comparison data:
1. Capture the serial output to a file
2. Import the data into a spreadsheet or data visualization tool
3. Create charts comparing the two ADCs' performance
4. Calculate statistics such as:
   - Standard deviation (noise measurement)
   - Sampling frequency stability
   - Response time to load changes

## When to Choose Each ADC

**Choose MCP356x when:**
- You need high sampling rates (>100 samples/second)
- Multiple load cells must be read through a single ADC
- You require advanced filtering and configuration options
- SPI is already used in your project

**Choose HX711 when:**
- Lower cost is a priority
- Simpler integration is desired
- Standard load cell sampling rates are sufficient
- You're new to load cell interfacing

## Getting Started

1. Connect both ADCs according to the pin configurations in each example
2. Upload the desired comparison code to your microcontroller
3. Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud
4. Apply test weights or forces to your load cells
5. Capture the data for analysis
