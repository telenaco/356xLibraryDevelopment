The overall approach of creating a 3-axis load cell library by inheriting from the previous libraries seems reasonable. However, there are a few observations and suggestions to consider before proceeding with the implementation of the source code:

1. Dependency on MCP356xScale: The MCP356x3axis class heavily relies on the MCP356xScale class. Make sure that the MCP356xScale class is well-tested, reliable, and provides all the necessary functionality for the 3-axis load cell library.

2. Ownership and Lifetime Management: The MCP356x3axis class takes pointers to MCP356xScale objects in its constructor. It's important to ensure proper ownership and lifetime management of these objects. Consider using smart pointers (e.g., std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr) to handle the ownership and avoid manual memory management.

3. Calibration and Crosstalk Compensation: The library provides functions for setting and getting calibration coefficients, but it doesn't explicitly handle crosstalk compensation. Consider adding functions or mechanisms to apply crosstalk compensation based on the calibration coefficients. This may involve additional calculations or transformations on the raw readings.

4. Error Handling: The library should handle potential errors gracefully. Consider adding error handling mechanisms, such as returning error codes or throwing exceptions, in case of any failures or invalid inputs.

5. Thread Safety: If the library is intended to be used in a multithreaded environment, ensure that the necessary synchronization mechanisms are in place to protect shared resources and prevent data races.

6. Unit Testing: Develop comprehensive unit tests to verify the correctness and reliability of the library. Test various scenarios, edge cases, and possible error conditions to ensure the library behaves as expected.

7. Documentation: Provide clear and detailed documentation for the library, including usage instructions, function descriptions, and any necessary precautions or limitations. Good documentation will make it easier for users to integrate and utilize the library effectively.

8. Performance Optimization: If performance is critical, consider optimizing the library for efficiency. This may involve using efficient data structures, minimizing memory allocations, and optimizing algorithms where possible.

9. Configurability: Consider providing configuration options or parameters to customize the behavior of the library based on specific application requirements. This could include options for different calibration methods, filtering techniques, or output formats.

10. Extensibility: Design the library in a way that allows for easy extension or customization. Users may have specific requirements or need to integrate additional functionality. Providing a flexible and modular architecture can enhance the usability and adaptability of the library.

These are some general observations and considerations to keep in mind while developing the source code for the MCP356x3axis library. They aim to improve the robustness, usability, and maintainability of the library.

If you're happy with the approach and have considered these points, I can proceed with writing the source code for the `MCP356x3axis.cpp` file.
